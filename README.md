This is not a generic dotfiles repo. It is a `chezmoi`-managed operating environment for AI-assisted engineering built around a **four-Codex workflow**: **exploration**, **implementation**, **review/refinement**, and **verification/docs**, with the real differentiator living above shell and editor config in tracked instructions, runtime defaults, reusable skills, and execution plans.

For recruiters or clients, the hook is straightforward: this repo shows how I turn AI usage into **operational, inspectable, and repeatable** engineering work instead of ad hoc prompting. It is a concrete proxy for how I work on real software: **leverage**, **reproducibility**, **small reversible changes**, **verification**, and minimal hidden state, all version-controlled in the open.

## Install And Bootstrap

The minimum bootstrap path is `git` plus `chezmoi`. Add Codex CLI if you
want the AI operating layer, and add Neo4j plus the local Graphiti
checkout only if you want the optional memory layer described later in
this README.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example-user/dotfiles.git
cd ai-cli-dotfiles

# Preview what this repo would write into $HOME
chezmoi -S "$PWD" diff

# Apply the tracked source state from this clone
chezmoi -S "$PWD" apply
```

That apply path also follows the upstream native-discovery install flow
for [`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers): chezmoi
clones it to `~/.codex/superpowers` and writes
`~/.agents/skills/superpowers` as a symlink to its `skills/` directory,
so Codex can discover the bundle without a bootstrap block in
`~/.codex/AGENTS.md`.

To use the AI layer after the dotfiles are in place, open the repo in
Codex:

```bash
codex
```

In this repo, `codex` resolves to a tracked wrapper installed from
[`scripts/executable_codex`][codex-wrapper].
It ensures the Graphiti startup command
`uv run main.py --transport stdio --database-provider neo4j --model qwen3:14b`
is already running in the background before it hands off to the real
Codex CLI.

If you want the Graphiti memory layer, keep Neo4j reachable on
`localhost:7687` and follow
[`docs/graphiti-mcp-codex.md`][graphiti-codex-doc] for the repo-specific
MCP setup.

## How To Use It

Treat this repository as the source of truth for the environment rather
than editing live files under `$HOME` directly.

1. Edit the tracked source files in this repo.
2. Preview the resulting home-directory diff with `chezmoi -S "$PWD" diff`.
3. Run `refresh-config` after config changes when you want the repo, the tracked Codex config, chezmoi-managed files, and generated shortcuts brought back into sync in one step. The repo-tracked `dot_codex/config.toml` is the source of truth and is reapplied to `~/.codex/config.toml`.
4. Apply the changes with `chezmoi -S "$PWD" apply` when you want the direct chezmoi path instead of the higher-level refresh helper.
5. Run `codex` from the repo root when you want the tracked AGENTS chain, Codex config, local skills, and plans to shape the session. In this repo that launcher also makes sure the Graphiti sidecar command is already running in the background before the real Codex binary starts.
6. Keep the root `README.md` updated whenever the repo's public workflow changes, especially for install steps, usage, command flags, the repo-based tech stack section, and recruiter-facing positioning.

## Core Command Reference

These are the core entrypoints the README depends on. The flags listed
below are verified against local CLI help in this repo's environment.

| Command | When to use it | Flags and options that matter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chezmoi -S "$PWD" diff` | Preview what the checked-out source tree would change in `$HOME`. | `-S` / `--source` points chezmoi at this clone instead of the default source directory. `--reverse` flips the diff direction when you need the comparison the other way around. |
| `chezmoi -S "$PWD" apply -n -v` | Dry-run an apply with extra detail before touching files in `$HOME`. | `-S` / `--source` uses this repo as the source state. `-n` / `--dry-run` previews changes without writing them. `-v` / `--verbose` prints more detail. |
| `chezmoi -S "$PWD" apply` | Apply the tracked source state from this clone into `$HOME`. | `-S` / `--source` uses this repo as the source state. `-P` / `--parent-dirs` is useful when you apply a nested target and also want its parent directories handled. |
| `codex` or `codex -C /path/to/your-clone` | Start Codex in the repo so the tracked instruction chain and config take effect. The repo wrapper also ensures the Graphiti sidecar command is running first. | `-C` / `--cd` sets the repo root when you launch from another directory. `--search` enables live web search for tasks that need current external information. |
| `codex mcp list --json` | Verify which MCP servers Codex is loading from the tracked config. | `--json` emits machine-readable output that is easier to inspect or diff. |

## Tech Stack And Why Chosen

This section is intentionally based on what the repo actually contains,
not on generic dotfiles or AI-tool boilerplate.

| Layer | Repo evidence | Why chosen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chezmoi` | [`dot_config/chezmoi/chezmoi-template.toml.tmpl`][chezmoi-template] plus the templated repo structure | It keeps the environment reproducible across machines instead of trapping the setup inside one laptop. |
| Codex CLI and tracked config | [`dot_codex/config.toml`][codex-config] | It versions model, reasoning, trust, MCP, and session defaults so a new Codex pane starts from repo policy instead of memory or re-prompting. |
| AGENTS instruction chain | [`AGENTS.md`][agents-baseline], [`AGENTS.repo.md`][agents-repo-pointer], and [`dot_codex/AGENTS.md`][codex-agents] | It turns workflow expectations into inspectable repo policy for planning, verification, commit hygiene, and docs sync. |
| Local skills | [`dot_agents/skills/`][skills-dir] | They package recurring jobs into reusable local capabilities instead of re-explaining the same workflows in every session. |
| Graphiti MCP with Neo4j | [`dot_codex/config.toml`][codex-config] and [`docs/graphiti-mcp-codex.md`][graphiti-codex-doc] | It adds a retrievable memory layer for multi-session work where provenance and evolving context matter. |
| Shell and terminal tooling | [`dot_config/fish/config.fish.tmpl`][fish-config], [`dot_tmux.conf`][tmux-conf], [`dot_config/kitty/kitty.conf`][kitty-conf], and [`dot_config/i3/config.tmpl`][i3-config] | It optimizes for terminal-first execution and multiple parallel panes instead of a single-editor workflow. |
| Python and Bash automation | [`scripts/`][scripts-dir] and skill helper scripts under [`dot_agents/skills/`][skills-dir] | It keeps repeatable operations small, inspectable, and version-controlled instead of burying them in chat instructions or manual muscle memory. |

## Workflow At A Glance

**The screenshot above is the workflow.** The README now centers the repo area highlighted by the left-side tree: the tracked instruction chain, Codex defaults, reusable skills, and plans that make parallel terminal-agent work faster and more disciplined.

```text
AGENTS.md
AGENTS.repo.md
dot_codex/
dot_agents/
plans/
```

Those files and directories define the operating layer:

- **[`AGENTS.md`][agents-baseline]:** the reusable cross-repo baseline for AI assistants.
- **[`AGENTS.repo.md`][agents-repo-pointer]:** the repo-local pointer that says [`dot_codex/AGENTS.md`][codex-agents] is authoritative for Codex here.
- **[`dot_codex/AGENTS.md`][codex-agents]:** the canonical merged instruction document for this repository, which pushes Codex toward plan-first, verification-heavy engineering behavior.
- **[`dot_codex/config.toml`][codex-config]:** the tracked runtime config for model defaults, reasoning level, trust boundaries, MCP servers, and session behavior.
- **[`dot_agents/skills/`][skills-dir]:** the reusable workflow layer for higher-level jobs like frontend design generation, redesign, premium visual polish, output enforcement, durable feedback memory, README recruiter-sync checks, minimalist/editorial UI design, CI repair, browser automation, screenshots, docs lookup, PDF work, image generation, transcription, commit planning with bottom-line message summaries, session-scoped git shipping, and direct verified git shipping. The live skill surface also includes the externally managed [`superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) bundle, exposed through `~/.agents/skills/superpowers` via chezmoi. For more detail on the repo-tracked local skills, see [`dot_agents/skills/README.md`][skills-readme].
- **[`plans/`][plans-dir]:** the place where non-trivial work becomes explicit, checklisted, reviewable, and easier to validate.

The screenshot still reflects a broader terminal-agent environment, but the main story here is the **Codex operating layer** that makes the workflow reproducible.

## AI Layer Highlights

The repo now treats the root `README.md` as part of the operating
surface, not as loose marketing copy. Repo-local guidance in
[`AGENTS.repo.md`][agents-repo-readme-sync]
explicitly requires the README to stay aligned whenever these paths
materially change:

```text
AGENTS.md
AGENTS.repo.md
dot_codex/
dot_agents/
plans/
```

That matters because the most interesting changes here are often not
traditional dotfile tweaks. They are workflow upgrades.

- **Instruction chain upgrades:** changes in [`AGENTS.md`][agents-baseline],
  [`AGENTS.repo.md`][agents-repo-pointer], or [`dot_codex/AGENTS.md`][codex-agents] can tighten planning,
  verification, bug-fix discipline, and repo-specific behavior.
- **Scripted manual handoffs:** when Codex has to hand commands off instead of running them directly, the instruction chain now prefers writing a script and explicitly calling out any required `sudo` invocation.
- **Runtime default upgrades:** [`dot_codex/config.toml`][codex-config] versions the
  model, reasoning, trust, MCP, and session defaults that every new
  Codex pane inherits.
- **Persistent memory via Graphiti:** the MCP layer can launch a local
  Graphiti memory service over `stdio`; the repo-local setup, validation,
  and troubleshooting live in [`docs/graphiti-mcp-codex.md`][graphiti-codex-doc].
- **Skill surface growth:** [`dot_agents/skills/`][skills-dir] packages recurring
  jobs into reusable local capabilities instead of one-off prompts.
- **Commit-time README gate:** [`readme-recruiter-sync`](dot_agents/skills/readme-recruiter-sync/SKILL.md) keeps install steps, usage, command flags, stack rationale, and recruiter-facing positioning in sync before commit workflows ship changes.
- **Push-after-commit default:** when a commit workflow in this repo creates a commit, the instruction chain defaults to pushing the active branch immediately afterward unless the user explicitly says not to.
- **Execution discipline:** [`plans/`][plans-dir] makes non-trivial tasks
  explicit, reviewable, and easier to validate after the fact.

Keeping the README tied to those changes makes the repo easier to
evaluate: the high-leverage additions stay visible instead of
disappearing into internal docs and folder trees.

## Graphiti Memory Layer

Graphiti is the memory and retrieval layer that sits beside the repo's
instruction chain, local skills, and ExecPlans. In this setup it is not
just a theoretical fit. It is a local MCP service that helps Codex keep
longer-running work coherent across sessions.

The practical use case is straightforward:

- preserve evolving facts about tasks, services, files, branches, and
  verification state instead of leaving them buried in chat scrollback
- keep provenance back to the source episodes that produced those facts,
  which matters when review or verification needs to check where a claim
  came from
- support multi-session Codex work where exploration, implementation,
  review, and docs may all need the same durable context

The local setup is intentionally repo-specific. Instead of relying on
Graphiti's default HTTP transport, the working config launches Graphiti
over `stdio` from `/home/example/coding/graphiti/mcp_server`, keeps
runtime settings in that checkout's `.env`, and expects Neo4j on
`localhost:7687`. That keeps the Codex-side config small and avoids the
host-port `8000` collision that already exists on this machine.

The repo-level `codex` wrapper also starts the same Graphiti command in
the background before handing off to the real Codex CLI. That sidecar is
useful for making sure the command is already alive when you launch
Codex, but it does not replace the actual stdio MCP child that Codex
spawns for tool communication.

The detailed setup, validation steps, and troubleshooting notes live in
[`docs/graphiti-mcp-codex.md`][graphiti-codex-doc]. The short version is:

1. Keep Neo4j running on `localhost:7687`.
2. Let Codex launch Graphiti through the `graphiti` MCP entry in
   [`dot_codex/config.toml`][codex-config].
3. Use Graphiti as the temporal memory layer that complements AGENTS
   files, skills, and ExecPlans instead of replacing them.

That ordering matters for the four-Codex workflow because the difficult
part of parallel agent work is not just generating code. It is keeping
working state coherent across exploration, implementation, review, and
verification. Graphiti helps by making evolving context retrievable,
inspectable, and historically aware.

## Why This Is Different From Normal Dotfiles

Regular dotfiles repos usually do a familiar set of jobs well: shell aliases, editor preferences, window manager setup, themes, and local convenience.

**This repo still does that, but that is not the main story.**

The main story is that it treats AI-assisted engineering as something worth configuring with the same seriousness people usually reserve for shells and editors. In practice, that means:

- **It does not just configure tools; it configures tool behavior.**
- **It does not just store preferences; it stores operating rules.**
- **It does not just make one machine comfortable; it makes agent workflows reproducible.**
- **It does not just save keystrokes; it reduces re-prompting, context drift, and fragile local state.**

That is the difference between a personalized Linux setup and a **versioned engineering environment**.

## How The System Works

The part of the repo that matters most looks like this:

```text
AGENTS.md
AGENTS.repo.md
dot_codex/
dot_agents/
plans/
```

Those files and directories form the operating layer for the workflow:

1. **The AGENTS chain** defines how Codex should behave in this repo.
2. **[`dot_codex/config.toml`][codex-config]** defines startup defaults, trust boundaries, and session behavior.
3. **[`dot_agents/skills/`][skills-dir]** packages recurring work into reusable local skills.
4. **[`plans/`][plans-dir]** keeps larger tasks explicit, checklisted, and reviewable.
5. **`chezmoi`** makes the whole setup reproducible instead of trapping it in one machine's local state.

Mechanically, this matters because Codex CLI is designed to read AGENTS-style instruction files into context and inherit defaults from `~/.codex/config.toml`. That means the repo is not merely documenting the workflow; it is **actively shaping how each session starts and behaves**.

## Core Components

### 1. Instruction chain

[`AGENTS.md`][agents-baseline], [`AGENTS.repo.md`][agents-repo-pointer], and [`dot_codex/AGENTS.md`][codex-agents] are the behavioral backbone.

- **[`AGENTS.md`][agents-baseline]** holds the shared baseline.
- **[`AGENTS.repo.md`][agents-repo-pointer]** tells Codex to treat [`dot_codex/AGENTS.md`][codex-agents] as authoritative for this repo.
- **[`dot_codex/AGENTS.md`][codex-agents]** is the canonical working document for this codebase.

That canonical document is not generic philosophy. It encodes concrete engineering behavior:

- **Plan mode for non-trivial work:** larger tasks should be broken into explicit steps, assumptions, risks, and verification, instead of being handled as one long improvisation. In practice, that means work should move through an ExecPlan in [`plans/`][plans-dir] when the task is big enough that sequencing and review matter.
- **Failing reproducers before bug fixes:** bug work should start with a test or other executable proof of failure, so the fix is grounded in observed behavior instead of guesswork. The target is to make the problem fail for the right reason first, then fix it, then keep that reproducer as a regression check.
- **Explicit verification before done:** work is not considered complete until the result is demonstrated through tests, diffs, logs, or a clear manual check. A change is not "done" because the code looks right; it is done when there is evidence that behavior matches the claim.
- **Docs updates with behavior changes:** when the workflow or behavior changes, the related documentation and plans should change with it so the repo stays truthful. If a README, plan, setup step, or operator workflow is now different, the documentation should be updated in the same change rather than deferred.
- **Small reversible diffs:** changes should be narrow, reviewable, and easy to back out, rather than broad refactors that mix multiple concerns. That pushes the work toward focused commits and away from drive-by cleanup that makes failures harder to isolate.
- **Conventional Commits:** commit history should communicate intent clearly and consistently, not leave future readers to infer what happened. A subject like `docs: expand README instruction-chain examples` is part of the system's operating discipline, not just a stylistic preference.
- **A clear definition of done:** the system defines completion as working implementation, updated supporting docs or types where needed, and enough context for another engineer to verify the result. The goal is that someone else can read the diff, run the checks, and understand why the task is actually complete.

This is where agent behavior stops being prompt folklore and becomes **versioned repo policy**.

### 2. Tracked Codex defaults

[`dot_codex/config.toml`][codex-config] makes each Codex session start strong instead of neutral.

It tracks the default model and reasoning effort, trusted local project paths, MCP servers, notification and status-line preferences, and extra developer instructions for commit and plan hygiene. In the current config, even commit discipline is codified: plan updates should ship with related work, and commit messages should use concise Conventional Commit subjects with minimal but clear bullet summaries in the body.

That matters because a new Codex pane inherits the same defaults immediately. **No re-briefing. No guesswork.**

One concrete example is the repo-local Graphiti MCP entry: Codex can launch the
local Graphiti checkout over `stdio`, while the detailed setup and validation
workflow lives in [`docs/graphiti-mcp-codex.md`][graphiti-codex-doc].

### 3. Reusable local skills

[`dot_agents/skills/`][skills-dir] turns repeated prompting into reusable capabilities. For more detail on my packaged skills, see [`dot_agents/skills/README.md`][skills-readme].

The current live skill tree is best understood as a few high-signal categories rather than a full inventory here. The detailed catalog lives in [`dot_agents/skills/README.md`][skills-readme].

#### Git workflow

Representative highlights:

- **[`commit-plan`](dot_agents/skills/commit-plan/SKILL.md):** turns a dirty worktree into a clean commit plan without staging, committing, or rewriting history.
- **[`commit-session`](dot_agents/skills/commit-session/SKILL.md):** ships only the files owned by the current Codex session, including directly touched files that were already dirty when the session started and an observed-touch-only fallback when a session missed its pre-write baseline, then pushes the successful scoped commit by default unless I explicitly say not to.
- **[`gh-fix-ci`](dot_agents/skills/gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md):** investigates failing GitHub Actions checks with `gh`, summarizes the real failure, and plans the fix before touching code.

This category matters because the repo does not just store git aliases or notes about workflow. It stores reusable guardrails for commit hygiene, session scoping, CI repair, and immediate push behavior after successful commits.

#### Design and frontend

Representative highlights:

- **[`design-taste-frontend`](dot_agents/skills/design-taste-frontend/SKILL.md):** generates new React or Next.js interfaces with explicit art direction, stronger structure, and more disciplined motion than default LLM UI output.
- **[`high-end-visual-design`](dot_agents/skills/high-end-visual-design/SKILL.md):** pushes visual polish toward agency-grade work with stricter typography, spacing, card treatment, and motion standards.
- **[`redesign-existing-projects`](dot_agents/skills/redesign-existing-projects/SKILL.md):** upgrades an existing site or app in place by auditing the current UI and applying targeted design improvements without breaking functionality.

This category matters because it turns design direction into a repeatable local capability instead of a one-off prompting exercise.

#### Research and output control

Representative highlights:

- **[`feedback-memory`](dot_agents/skills/feedback-memory/SKILL.md):** carries forward durable user corrections and workflow preferences across sessions by reading and appending a repo-tracked plain-text `feedback.log`.
- **[`readme-recruiter-sync`](dot_agents/skills/readme-recruiter-sync/SKILL.md):** hard-gates commit workflows on a root README that is still truthful about install, usage, core command flags, the repo-based tech stack, and recruiter-facing value.
- **[`openai-docs`](dot_agents/skills/openai-docs/SKILL.md):** answers OpenAI product and API questions from current official docs first, with citations and minimal reliance on general browsing.

This category matters because it makes repository knowledge, documentation quality, and output discipline persistent instead of relying on memory inside a single session.

#### Browser and desktop automation

Representative highlights:

- **[`playwright`](dot_agents/skills/playwright/SKILL.md):** drives a real browser from the terminal for navigation, screenshots, extraction, and UI debugging.
- **[`playwright-interactive`](dot_agents/skills/playwright-interactive/SKILL.md):** keeps a Playwright browser session alive for faster repeated inspection and debugging passes in the same context.
- **[`screenshot`](dot_agents/skills/screenshot/SKILL.md):** handles desktop- or window-level capture requests when an OS-level screenshot is the most reliable path.

This category matters because terminal-first agent work still needs direct access to browser state and desktop evidence when text-only inspection is not enough.

#### Documents and media

Representative highlights:

- **[`imagegen`](dot_agents/skills/imagegen/SKILL.md):** runs image generation and editing workflows through the OpenAI Image API with reproducible CLI-driven execution.
- **[`pdf`](dot_agents/skills/pdf/SKILL.md):** handles PDF reading, generation, and review workflows where rendered layout matters as much as extracted text.
- **[`transcribe`](dot_agents/skills/transcribe/SKILL.md):** converts speech from audio or video into text with optional diarization and known-speaker hints when needed.

This category matters because the repo packages higher-friction media workflows as inspectable local tools instead of leaving them as ad hoc prompts.

Several skills are packaged with `SKILL.md`, agent metadata, helper scripts, reference material, or explicit `SOURCE.md` provenance notes, which makes them closer to local tools than to one-off prompts. The frontend design skill cluster was imported from [Leonxlnx/taste-skill](https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill) with permission, and each imported skill directory includes a `SOURCE.md` file that records the upstream path and commit.

That is one of the clearest differences from a normal dotfiles repo. Instead of re-explaining recurring work every week, the workflow is already **packaged and versioned**.

### 4. ExecPlans

[`plans/`][plans-dir] is where non-trivial work stays explicit.

A representative plan like [`plans/commit-all-dirty.md`][plan-commit-all-dirty] does not just say "commit the changes." It inventories the dirty worktree, groups changes into coherent commit boundaries, notes where partial staging is required inside a single file, defines verification after each step, and calls out concrete risks.

That is **execution discipline you can inspect**.

The point of keeping plans in the repo is simple: larger tasks should not live only in chat scrollback or memory.

## Four Codex Workflow

The operating model is four Codex sessions in parallel, each with a distinct job:

1. **Exploration**: read the codebase, trace behavior, inspect docs, and surface constraints before editing.
2. **Implementation**: make focused code changes once the path is clear.
3. **Review and refinement**: look for regressions, weak assumptions, and cleaner solutions.
4. **Verification and docs**: run tests, validate behavior, and keep documentation or plans aligned with the work.

This split only works because the sessions stay aligned. When every pane inherits the same instruction chain, config defaults, trust rules, and reusable skills, parallelism becomes **leverage instead of chaos**.

## Reproducibility Through Chezmoi

**The productivity gain is not trapped inside one laptop.**

This repo is `chezmoi`-managed, which means the environment itself is tracked as source state and can be applied back into `$HOME` through the standard `chezmoi` workflow. The same files that shape the Codex workflow, including AGENTS documents, Codex config, skills, aliases, templates, and supporting dotfiles, are part of a reproducible setup rather than fragile local state.

That matters for two reasons.

First, **the workflow is portable**. When the setup changes, the change is versioned.

Second, **the leverage is inspectable**. You can see exactly which instructions, defaults, packaged skills, and plans are doing the work.

Typical commands are still the usual ones:

```bash
chezmoi -S "$PWD" diff
chezmoi -S "$PWD" apply
```

The difference is what is being reproduced. It is not only shell comfort. It is the **operating environment for AI-assisted engineering**.

## Rest Of Repo

The rest of the repository is still a full desktop-dotfiles setup, not just an AI CLI config repo. The major non-AI surfaces break down like this.

### Shells And Shared Shortcuts

- **[`dot_bashrc`][dot-bashrc] and [`dot_zshrc`][dot-zshrc]:** keep the fallback shells in sync around shared aliases, keyboard repeat rate, `wal` colors, and the usual shell-framework hooks, while dedicated X startup files own keyboard remaps.
- **[`aliases/key_aliases.tmpl`][aliases-key-aliases], [`aliases/key_dirs.tmpl`][aliases-key-dirs], and [`aliases/key_files.tmpl`][aliases-key-files]:** form the canonical shortcut layer. [`scripts/executable_sync-shortcuts`][sync-shortcuts] regenerates shell aliases, fish abbreviations, and ranger mappings from those sources.
- **[`dot_config/fish/config.fish.tmpl`][fish-config]:** is the main interactive shell setup. It wires in prompt and path configuration, auto-syncs shortcuts, starts X on login when appropriate, and loads the large helper set under [`dot_config/fish/functions/`][fish-functions].
- **[`dot_config/fish/completions/`][fish-completions]:** adds project-specific and tool-specific completions for commands like `kubectl`, `minikube`, `pass`, `timetrace`, and `watson`.

### Editor, Terminal, And Media

- **[`dot_config/kitty/kitty.conf`][kitty-conf] and [`dot_config/st/config.def.h.tmpl`][st-config]:** share the themed terminal layer, including Nerd Font choices, `wal` color integration, opacity, and clipboard behavior.
- **[`dot_tmux.conf`][tmux-conf]:** is the multiplexing layer with a custom prefix, mouse mode, TPM plugins, Powerline-style status, and copy-mode mappings that push selections to `xclip`.
- **[`dot_vimrc.tmpl`][vimrc] plus [`dot_config/nvim/init.vim`][nvim-init]:** define the main editing environment across Vim and Neovim, with the plugin list, language-specific autocommands, and leader mappings for git, formatting, folds, and navigation.
- **[`dot_config/mpv/`][mpv-dir], [`dot_config/zathura/`][zathura-dir], and [`dot_config/neofetch/`][neofetch-dir]:** round out the terminal-centric app stack for media playback, PDF reading, and system info.

### Window Manager And Desktop UI

- **[`dot_xinitrc.tmpl`][xinitrc], [`dot_Xresources.tmpl`][xresources], and the [`dot_Xmodmap` variants][xmodmap-family]:** control X startup, DPI and font choices, keyboard remaps, `wal` wallpaper theming, and host-specific differences between desktop, laptop, and VM setups.
- **[`dot_config/i3/config.tmpl`][i3-config]:** is the main desktop control plane for workspace movement, app assignments, launcher bindings, display and audio shortcuts, layout control, and the external hands-free toggle binding on `Pause`.
- **[`dot_config/i3blocks/`][i3blocks-dir] and its script directory:** provide the status bars for primary and secondary displays, with blocks for things like battery, wifi, volume, Spotify, temperature, and crypto or ticker data.
- **[`dot_config/dunst/dunstrc`][dunst-conf] and [`dot_config/picom/picom.conf`][picom-conf]:** shape the notification and compositing layer, while other app-specific configs under [`dot_config/`][dot-config-dir] cover tools like `MangoHud`, `Vesktop`, `Code`, and `Cursor`.

### Productivity And File Management

- **[`dot_taskrc`][taskrc] and [`dot_taskopenrc`][taskopenrc]:** set up Taskwarrior and Taskopen with contexts, urgency tuning, sync targets, and the preferred note or annotation workflow.
- **[`dot_config/ranger/`][ranger-dir]:** contains the file-manager workflow, including custom commands, fzf helpers, preview logic, plugins, and the shared key-mapping layer generated from the aliases templates.
- **[`dot_config/neomutt/neomuttrc`][neomutt-conf] and [`dot_config/msmtp/config`][msmtp-config]:** cover terminal email, while [`dot_config/zathura/zathurarc`][zathura-conf] keeps the reading stack aligned with the rest of the theme.
- **[`dot_config/mgba/`][mgba-dir] and [`dot_minikube/config/config.json`][minikube-config]:** show the broader pattern of app-specific config managed in the same repo, including emulator settings and local Kubernetes defaults.

### Scripts, Assets, And Machine-Specific State

- **[`scripts/`][scripts-dir]:** holds the automation layer behind the desktop, including wallpaper shuffling, `dmenu` helpers, audio sink changes, pass integration, package installation, finance or status scripts, backup helpers, small terminal utilities, and repair helpers such as restoring a broken `fnm` + Codex install when a Node prefix is missing `npm` shims.
- **[`scripts/colors/`][scripts-colors-dir] and [`txt/`][txt-dir]:** hold supporting assets such as terminal art, package lists, backup exclude files, TeX cleanup inputs, USB notes, and other small operational datasets.
- **[`dot_config/chezmoi/chezmoi-template.toml.tmpl`][chezmoi-template]:** is the host-data entrypoint for machine-specific toggles such as `gui`, `ext_kb`, and `linux_os`, which then feed template logic across the repo.
- **[`private_dot_calcurse/`][calcurse-dir], [`private_dot_gnupg/`][gnupg-dir], and [`dot_ssh/`][ssh-dir]:** cover the sensitive or machine-population side of the setup, alongside config files like `msmtp` or `taskrc` that should be treated carefully when syncing credentials.

That broader dotfiles surface is still substantial, but the README stays centered on the **four-Codex operating environment** because that is the most distinctive and actively evolving part of the repo right now.
