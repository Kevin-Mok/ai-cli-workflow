# Business Point of View: AI Platform Strategy for Example Client and Tutoring Schools

Evaluate a teacher-controlled AI platform as an internal tool and a future
school business. Define the customers and first product slice, pilot real
Example Client and Maxfield workflows, measure the results, and use that evidence to
plan external pilots and pricing.

Date: 2026-05-09

## 1. Purpose

This document frames the AI tutoring platform from a business point of view.

The goal is not only to improve Example Client Education's internal teaching workflow, but to build a platform that can later be sold to other tutoring schools that face the same operational pain: preparing high-quality teaching materials, practice questions, worksheets, answer keys, explanations, and student feedback takes too much teacher time.

The first customer should be Example Client Education. The long-term customer should be small and mid-sized tutoring schools, especially STEM, contest-prep, coding, math, bilingual, and enrichment schools in Canada and similar markets.

## 2. Business Problem

Example Client Education has been operating for more than 10 years, but like many tutoring businesses, it still faces small-business constraints:

- Teachers spend many hours preparing class materials and practice questions.
- Good questions are hard to create, organize, reuse, and adapt.
- Contest-prep and coding courses require constant refreshes and variations.
- Students have different weak areas, but manual personalization is time-consuming.
- Parents expect clear progress updates, but writing them takes extra time.
- Materials often live across files, PDFs, slides, documents, chat messages, and teacher laptops.
- A small business cannot easily hire a full content-production team.

AI can help, but raw AI output is risky in education. Math answers can be wrong, coding explanations can be misleading, and parents/students should not receive unreviewed AI content.

The business opportunity is to build an AI workflow that saves time while keeping teachers in control.

## 3. Core Business Thesis

Tutoring schools do not primarily need an "AI tutor" that replaces teachers.

They need an AI-powered teaching material production system:

```text
School-owned materials
-> AI-assisted drafts
-> validation where possible
-> teacher review and approval
-> student practice / worksheet / parent feedback
```

The platform should help tutoring schools turn their own trusted materials into reviewed, reusable, personalized practice.

Short positioning:

> Private materials in. Teacher-approved practice out.

Longer positioning:

> An AI content workspace for tutoring schools that helps teachers generate, review, organize, assign, and reuse practice materials from their own trusted teaching resources.

## 4. Relationship Between Example Client and the Platform

Example Client should be the first operating environment, not just a demo customer.

Recommended brand structure:

- Main tutoring brand: **Example Client Education**
- Internal first version: **Example Client AI Prep Studio**
- Sellable software brand: **ExampleProject**
- Market wording: **ExampleProject by Example Client Education** during the early trust-building stage

Why not sell it as "Example Client AI" to other schools:

- Other tutoring schools may not want to use a competitor-branded platform.
- A neutral product name makes it easier to sell B2B.
- Example Client can still be credited as the education operator behind the platform.

Recommended public product line:

```text
ExampleProject
Built by Example Client Education
AI prep, practice, and feedback platform for tutoring schools
```

### 4.1 Domain And Portal Strategy

Use Example Client's existing domain for the first internal launch, but keep ExampleProject ready to become its own platform brand.

Example Client launch:

```text
Example Clienteducation.com        Existing public Example Client website, unchanged
www.Example Clienteducation.com    Existing public Example Client website, unchanged
app.Example Clienteducation.com    ExampleProject entry point for teachers/admins/students
```

The entry page at `app.Example Clienteducation.com` should route users into the right experience:

```text
Teacher / Admin -> /admin
Student         -> /practice
```

Direct student assignment links can still go straight to a practice route:

```text
app.Example Clienteducation.com/practice/a/{assignment_code}
```

Long-term platform model:

```text
app.example-project.ai          Shared ExampleProject platform
schoolname.example-project.ai   Optional school subdomain
app.schooldomain.com      Optional customer-owned school domain
```

The business should support two domain models:

- **Shared platform domain:** schools use a ExampleProject-hosted domain such as `schoolname.example-project.ai`. This is simplest for Starter and Pro customers.
- **Customer-owned domain:** schools use their own domain or subdomain such as `app.schooldomain.com`. This should be a paid branding or premium feature.

Why this matters:

- many schools want the student/parent portal to promote their own school brand
- external schools may not want to send students to a Example Client-branded domain
- a shared ExampleProject domain is easier to launch and support
- customer-owned domains help higher-tier schools present the platform as part of their own business

Business rule:

```text
One platform, many schools, flexible domains.
```

The product should not fork code for each school. Branding and domain routing should be tenant configuration.

### 4.2 Account And Registration Strategy

Use Google login as the default sign-in method because many teachers and students already have Google accounts.

However, registration should not be fully open inside an existing school.

Example Client first-launch model:

```text
Teachers/Admins:
Example Client owner/admin sends invite -> user signs in with Google -> ExampleProject activates membership

Students:
student receives assignment link/code or class code -> optional Google login -> ExampleProject connects the student record
```

Business rule:

```text
Google login proves the person.
ExampleProject decides the school, role, and access.
```

External-school SaaS model:

- a new school owner may self-sign up later to create a new tenant
- the school owner invites teachers/admins
- teachers/admins invite students or issue class/assignment codes
- no random user should be able to self-register as a teacher inside another school's tenant

Why this matters:

- protects each school's private content
- prevents students joining the wrong class
- prevents duplicate or fake teacher accounts
- keeps tenant isolation clear for external customers
- reduces support problems for small school operators

## 5. Target Customers

### 5.1 First Customer: Example Client Education

Example Client should use the platform first for real internal courses. The first proof should be operational:

- Reduce teacher prep time.
- Create better reusable question banks.
- Improve homework and practice consistency.
- Track student weak areas more clearly.
- Generate parent feedback drafts faster.

Example Client should measure before/after workflow data, for example:

- Worksheet prep time before vs. after.
- Number of approved questions generated per week.
- Teacher time saved per course.
- Student practice completion rate.
- Parent satisfaction with feedback quality.

### 5.2 Second Customer: Maxfield Academy

Maxfield Academy can become the second internal proof customer after Example Client.

Maxfield is different from Example Client because it is not only a tutoring center. It is a private high school serving Grade 9 to Grade 12 students, with Ontario Secondary School Diploma credit-course responsibilities, course planning, assessment, reporting, admissions, and student support needs.

Based on the current public website, Maxfield's business context includes:

- Ministry of Education credit-granting positioning for OSSD pathways.
- Grade 9 to Grade 12 course offerings across English, mathematics, science, languages, arts, business, social science, computer science, and health/physical education.
- In-person and online classroom operation.
- International student admissions, Letter of Acceptance workflow, transcripts, tuition, homestay, and airport pickup support.
- A need to communicate personalized learning, global citizenship, academic excellence, and student life more clearly.

Maxfield can help validate whether the platform works beyond tutoring and can support private-school operations.

Recommended Maxfield internal version:

```text
Maxfield AI Academic Studio
AI-assisted course materials, assessment support, and student progress workflows for private high school programs.
```

The platform should help Maxfield with:

- Ontario course lesson-material preparation
- Unit quizzes and practice sets
- Rubric and assessment drafting
- Course outline and daily lesson-plan support
- Student learning evidence organization
- Report-card / progress-comment drafting
- International student language support
- University-pathway and course-planning support
- Admissions FAQ and document-checklist support
- Website content refresh for course and program pages

Important rule:

> For Maxfield, AI must support teacher and principal workflows, but credit-granting decisions, assessment, evaluation, reporting, and student records must remain under school control.

### 5.3 Early External Customers

The first external customers should be small and mid-sized tutoring schools with similar pain:

- Math contest prep schools
- Coding and STEM schools
- Bilingual / international curriculum schools
- Private high schools offering Ontario credit courses
- After-school enrichment centers
- Multi-subject tutoring centers with recurring weekly classes
- Schools that already own internal worksheets, slides, and question banks

Best initial geography:

- GTA: Stouffville, Markham, Richmond Hill, North York, Scarborough, Vaughan, Toronto
- Ontario and Canada next
- Later: U.S. and international tutoring schools

## 6. Initial Product Scope

The MVP should focus on saving teacher preparation time, not building a full LMS.

Source strategy and metadata should follow [Trusted Sources and Categorization System](trusted-sources.md).

### 6.1 Private Source Library

Each tutoring school can upload files, add source URLs for the system to import, or organize:

- Worksheets
- Lesson notes
- Slides
- Past homework
- Question banks
- Answer keys
- Coding exercises
- Curriculum outlines
- Teacher-created materials

The source URL flow matters for daily operations. A teacher should be able to paste a trusted public/reference URL, let ExampleProject download and store a reviewed copy, then tag it, confirm rights, and build KnowledgeNotes from it. Uploaded files and URL-imported sources should follow the same rights, trust, extraction, anchor, and approval workflow.

Key business value:

- Keeps institutional knowledge inside the school.
- Reduces dependency on individual teachers.
- Makes good content reusable.

### 6.1.1 Private Knowledge Base

The source library should feed an Obsidian-style private Knowledge Base.

The Knowledge Base is where a school organizes its teaching knowledge:

- concepts
- topics
- prerequisites
- common mistakes
- teaching notes
- generation guidance
- source anchors
- approved question coverage
- assessment coverage

The Knowledge Base should be stored as readable Markdown notes with properties and internal links. This is more AI-native and teacher-readable than storing KB content only in database tables.

PostgreSQL should still store relational application data, such as users, permissions, assignments, marks, workflow state, and audit history. It can also store rebuildable indexes over the Knowledge Vault, but it should not be the only copy of KB note content.

The Knowledge Base should not be positioned as a vector database or embedding index. The business asset is the school's approved teaching knowledge in Markdown: concepts, links, source anchors, guidance, and teacher review. AI generation should start from explicit Knowledge Vault context bundles so the school can see and improve the knowledge that drives the platform.

Business value:

- A school builds a reusable teaching brain over time.
- New teachers can understand the school's curriculum faster.
- AI generation becomes more consistent because it starts from approved school knowledge.
- Practice and exam generation can use a subject/topic KB slice instead of one isolated source file.
- The school's knowledge stays portable and inspectable.

### 6.2 AI Question and Variation Generator

Teachers should be able to generate:

- New practice questions
- Similar question variations
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Multiple-choice questions
- Short-answer questions
- Open response questions
- Proof / explanation questions
- Reading comprehension questions
- Coding or code-tracing questions
- Step-by-step solutions
- Hints
- Rubrics and expected key points
- Teacher-approved AI Learning Previews
- Topic tags
- Worksheets

This is likely the highest-value feature for Example Client and similar tutoring schools.

Teachers should control generation through saved Generation Profiles, not only through free-text prompts. A profile can define the question type mix, difficulty mix, answer format, grading mode, rubric, source alignment, visual needs, and teacher instruction.

Example:

```text
Generate 10 Grade 7 ratio questions from this source.
4 multiple choice, 4 short answer, 2 open response.
Keep difficulty medium.
Include full solution steps.
Use teacher-review rubric for open response questions.
```

This matters commercially because different schools have different teaching styles. One school may want contest-style multiple choice, another may want open thinking questions, and a private high school may need rubric-based course assessments.

AI Learning Preview is another important differentiator. The platform should show teachers the Original Source Preview for evidence, then help them create a separate student-facing preview such as an exact math diagram, story scene, character map, vocabulary visual, code trace, or concept storyboard.

The teacher should be able to regenerate or approve the preview. Only approved previews should reach students. This saves time while protecting quality.

Difficulty should also become a product feature. Use a D1-D5 internal scale with teacher/source estimate first, then collect observed student performance later. This lets the platform recommend better practice sets over time, such as "more D2/D3 ratio practice" or "ready for D4 contest problems."

### 6.3 Teacher Review Queue

Every AI-generated item should go through review:

- Approve
- Edit
- Reject
- Regenerate
- Mark as needs checking

The platform should make the teacher review process fast, because the business value depends on reducing time without reducing quality.

### 6.4 Answer Validation

The system should validate what can be validated:

- Multiple choice
- Integer answers
- Decimal answers with tolerance
- Fractions
- Basic algebra
- Geometry values when generated from structured specs
- Coding exercises using sample and hidden test cases

AI can draft explanations, but deterministic logic should decide correctness when possible.

### 6.5 Worksheet and Assignment Builder

Teachers should quickly create:

- Student worksheet PDF
- Teacher answer key
- Online practice link
- Homework package
- Topic review set
- Contest mock set

This directly saves time and creates visible business value.

### 6.6 Assessment / Exam Builder

Teachers also need to prepare higher-stakes materials for midterms, finals, end-of-term tests, placement tests, and mock contests.

This should be a separate Assessment Builder workflow because exams need stronger controls than normal homework practice.

Teachers should be able to create an Assessment Blueprint:

- assessment type: quiz, unit test, midterm, final, mock contest, entrance test
- course, subject, grade, and class
- total time and total marks
- topic coverage
- curriculum expectations or contest strands
- D1-D5 difficulty mix
- question type mix
- section structure
- marks per section
- allowed tools, such as calculator, formula sheet, dictionary, or IDE
- source set and approved question-bank scope
- rubric or marking style
- number of versions, such as Version A and Version B

The system should then help teachers:

- find reusable approved questions
- generate candidate questions for coverage gaps
- check duplicate or too-similar questions
- balance topic, marks, and difficulty coverage
- create answer keys
- create full solution guides
- create marking rubrics
- export student exam PDFs
- create online assessment packages when needed

Important business rule:

AI should generate a candidate pool, not directly finalize an exam. The teacher must review and lock the final assessment.

This is valuable for Example Client because exam preparation is repeated every term. It is also valuable for Maxfield because private-school course assessments need rubrics, marking guides, and course-aligned coverage.

### 6.7 Student Practice and Weak-Area Tracking

Students complete assigned practice online.

The platform tracks:

- Correct / incorrect
- Attempts
- Time spent
- Question topic
- Difficulty
- Marks and provisional marks
- Pending teacher-review questions
- Error patterns
- Weak topics

Teachers see what to review next.

After a practice session or exam, ExampleProject should automatically produce:

- student score or provisional score
- marks earned and total marks
- topic strengths and weak topics
- question-by-question result
- recommended next practice
- teacher summary of common mistakes
- class-level item analysis when multiple students complete the same assessment

This saves teacher time after class because the teacher does not need to manually calculate every result before knowing what to review next.

Important business rule:

Auto-marking is strongest for multiple choice, numeric, fraction, expression, coding-test, and rule-based short-answer questions. Open response, essay, proof, and complex reading answers should support rubric-assisted provisional scoring, but teachers should be able to review and finalize. For Maxfield or other credit-course workflows, official marks and records should remain teacher/school controlled.

### 6.8 Parent Feedback Drafts

The platform drafts parent-friendly updates:

- What the student improved
- What the student struggled with
- What the next learning plan is
- What homework/practice is recommended

Important rule:

> Parent communication must be teacher-reviewed before sending.

### 6.9 Private High School Academic Support

For Maxfield and similar private high schools, the platform should include school-facing workflows beyond tutoring worksheets.

Potential modules:

- Course material generator aligned to Ontario course codes and learning goals
- Unit plan and lesson plan drafting
- Quiz, test, assignment, and culminating task drafting
- Rubric drafting aligned to Ontario achievement categories
- Student work feedback drafts
- Report-card and progress-comment drafts
- Course outline and course calendar support
- Evidence tracker for assessments, lesson plans, and student work
- Academic support recommendations for students at risk
- International-student onboarding and language support materials

This module should be more compliance-aware than the tutoring-school module. It should help schools organize evidence and draft materials, but should not make final assessment or credit decisions.

## 7. First MVP Recommendation

The first MVP should not cover every course.

Recommended first slice:

> Grade 7/8 math contest practice with AI-generated question variations, teacher review, answer validation, worksheets, online practice, and weak-topic tracking.

Why this is the best first slice:

- Example Client already has real strength in contest and STEM preparation.
- Multiple-choice and numeric validation are easier than open writing.
- Contest-style questions have clear topics, difficulty, and answer logic.
- Parents understand the value of extra practice.
- Other tutoring schools also need contest and enrichment materials.

Second slice:

> Python / Java / CCC practice generator with sample tests, hidden tests, hints, and debugging feedback.

Why second:

- Coding is another Example Client strength.
- Output can be validated with test cases.
- It differentiates from general worksheet AI tools.

Private school slice:

> Grade 11/12 Ontario credit-course support for Maxfield, starting with math, science, English, or computer science course materials, assessments, rubrics, and progress feedback.

Why this is strategically useful:

- It proves the platform can serve schools, not only tutoring centers.
- Maxfield has broad Grade 9-12 course coverage and OSSD-oriented workflows.
- Course materials, rubrics, quizzes, and progress comments are repeatable high-frequency work.
- A private school has stronger needs around organization, records, assessment evidence, and parent/student communication.
- This creates a second product package for private schools and international-student programs.

## 10. Product Design Principles

### 10.1 Teacher-First

The main user is the teacher or school admin. Student tools are important, but the business pain starts with teacher preparation.

Teachers should be able to complete the normal content workflow without waiting for the owner every time:

```text
Upload source
-> Generate draft practice
-> Review and edit
-> Create worksheet or assignment
-> Track student results
```

Schools should still be able to control how much publishing power each teacher has:

- normal teachers can upload sources and generate/review drafts for their own classes
- trusted teachers may publish practice to their own classes
- curriculum leads or reviewers approve tenant-wide shared question-bank content
- admins/owners manage users, billing, domains, and school-wide settings

This balance matters because the product must save teacher time without weakening school control.

### 10.2 AI Behind the Workflow

AI should not be the main personality of the product. It should be a production assistant inside structured workflows.

### 10.3 Review Before Release

No generated material should reach students or parents without school approval.

### 10.4 Source-Based Generation

The platform should generate from trusted materials when possible, not from open-ended prompts alone.

### 10.5 Private Institutional Data

Each school's content must stay private. One school's materials should never be used for another school.

### 10.6 Practical Output

Every feature should produce something teachers already need:

- Worksheet
- Homework
- Quiz
- Practice set
- Solution key
- Progress report
- Coding exercise

## 11. Differentiation

The market already has many general AI tools for teachers. The platform should not compete by having more generic AI prompts.

The differentiation should be:

- Built specifically for tutoring schools and small private schools, not only public-school classrooms.
- Uses the tutoring school's own private materials.
- Focuses on question variation, worksheets, online practice, and weak-topic tracking.
- Keeps teacher approval as a core workflow.
- Supports STEM, math contest, coding, bilingual education, and Ontario private-school course workflows.
- Produces reusable question banks, not one-time AI output.
- Offers white-label capability for tutoring businesses.

## 12. Business Model

Recommended model: B2B SaaS plus onboarding service.

Possible packages:

### Starter

For small tutoring schools.

- 2-5 teachers
- Limited monthly AI generation
- Source library
- Review queue
- Worksheets
- Online practice

### Pro

For growing schools.

- More teachers
- More students
- More AI usage
- Weak-topic reports
- Parent feedback drafts
- Advanced source library

### School

For private high schools and credit-course providers.

- Course material workspace
- Unit and lesson planning support
- Assessment and rubric drafting
- Student progress comments
- Evidence organization for course delivery
- International student support materials
- Admin/principal review controls

### Premium / White Label

For established tutoring schools.

- School logo and colors
- Customer-owned domain, such as `app.schooldomain.com`
- Branded teacher/student portal
- Migration of existing question banks
- Advanced analytics
- Custom templates
- Priority support

Important pricing thought:

Charge by school and teacher seats, with AI usage limits. Do not price only by student count at the beginning, because the strongest value is teacher time saved.

## 13. Sales Message

For Example Client website:

> Example Client uses AI to help teachers prepare more targeted practice while keeping every learning material teacher-reviewed.

For external tutoring schools:

> ExampleProject helps tutoring schools turn their own materials into reviewed worksheets, online practice, and progress feedback in less time.

For private high schools:

> ExampleProject helps private schools prepare course materials, assessments, rubrics, and progress feedback faster while keeping teachers and school leaders in control.

Short pitch:

> Save teacher prep time. Reuse your best materials. Keep teachers in control.

## 15. Risks and Mitigation

### 15.1 AI Accuracy Risk

Risk:

- AI may generate wrong answers, bad explanations, or confusing wording.

Mitigation:

- Use teacher review.
- Use deterministic validators.
- Track source references.
- Start with question types that are easier to verify.

### 15.2 Copyright and Source Material Risk

Risk:

- Schools may upload copyrighted materials or third-party contest content.

Mitigation:

- Terms should require schools to confirm usage rights.
- Product should separate source references from generated variants.
- Example Client should use owned or properly permitted materials for commercial use.

### 15.3 Privacy Risk

Risk:

- Student data and uploaded materials may include personal or sensitive information.

Mitigation:

- Minimize student PII.
- Avoid sending unnecessary student data to AI providers.
- Use school-level data isolation.
- Keep audit logs.
- Provide clear privacy policy and consent language.

### 15.4 Private School Compliance Risk

Risk:

- Private high school workflows involve credit-course integrity, assessment, evaluation, reporting, student records, and inspection-readiness materials.
- AI-generated course or assessment materials may be inappropriate if treated as final authority.

Mitigation:

- Keep AI outputs in draft status until reviewed by teachers or school leadership.
- Add approval history for course outlines, lesson plans, assessments, rubrics, and progress comments.
- Separate tutoring practice tools from credit-course assessment records.
- Align private-school features with Ontario policy references and school-defined procedures.
- Do not automate final marks, credit decisions, or official student records.

### 15.5 Market Risk

Risk:

- General AI tools may already satisfy many teacher needs.

Mitigation:

- Focus on tutoring-school workflows, private content, review, worksheets, online practice, and weak-topic tracking.
- Sell operational time savings, not generic AI novelty.

### 15.6 Adoption Risk

Risk:

- Teachers may not want another tool.

Mitigation:

- Make the workflow simple.
- Start from existing materials.
- Produce outputs teachers already use.
- Measure time saved.

## 16. Recommended Next Actions

1. Choose the first internal Example Client course for the MVP.
2. Collect 20-50 owned or safe-to-use source questions/materials.
3. Define the first question types and validation rules.
4. Build the teacher review and worksheet workflow first.
5. Use the tool for a real Example Client class for 4-6 weeks.
6. Choose one Maxfield credit-course workflow for a second pilot, such as Grade 11 Functions, Grade 12 Advanced Functions, Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors, Grade 11/12 Computer Science, or English.
7. Collect Maxfield-owned course outlines, lesson materials, assignments, rubrics, and sample progress comments for that pilot.
8. Measure time saved and teacher satisfaction.
9. Create one Example Client case study and one Maxfield case study.
10. Identify 2-3 friendly tutoring schools and 1 private-school contact for pilot conversations.
11. Prepare a simple landing page for the platform once the internal proof exists.

## 17. Summary

The strongest business opportunity is not a public AI chatbot and not a generic worksheet generator.

The strongest opportunity is a teacher-controlled AI production platform for tutoring schools.

Example Client should first use it internally to solve its own material-preparation pain. Then the same platform can be packaged for other tutoring schools that need the same thing:

```text
Less prep time.
Better reusable materials.
More personalized practice.
Teacher-approved quality.
Private school-owned content.
```

Maxfield Academy should be the second proof customer. This expands the platform from tutoring-school practice production into private-school academic operations:

```text
Course materials.
Assessment drafts.
Rubrics.
Progress feedback.
Student support.
School-controlled review.
```
