# Trusted Sources and Categorization System

Plan how ExampleProject selects and uses reliable teaching sources with clear
permissions. Record each source's trust, rights, and academic tags, review it
before generation, then validate and approve linked teaching material before
release.

Date: 2026-05-09

## 1. Purpose

The platform should never treat AI-generated teaching material as source-free content.

Every lesson, worksheet, practice question, quiz, assessment, rubric, explanation, or parent/student feedback draft should connect back to a trusted source or a teacher-approved internal standard.

Core rule:

```text
No source, no approved material.
```

The platform should support three related goals:

1. Help Example Client and Maxfield prepare material faster.
2. Protect quality by grounding output in trusted sources.
3. Protect the future SaaS business by tracking source rights and avoiding unsafe content reuse.

## 2. Source Strategy

The source library should separate two ideas:

- **Trust**: Is this source educationally reliable?
- **Rights**: Are we allowed to copy, adapt, display, or commercialize this source?

A source can be highly trustworthy but still not safe to copy into a commercial product. For example, official contest problems can be excellent teaching references, but the platform should still confirm commercial reuse rights before including original problems in a paid product.

Recommended principle:

```text
Use official and trusted sources for alignment.
Use owned, licensed, public-domain, or clearly permitted content for product output.
Use restricted sources only for reference, inspiration, or internal review unless permission is confirmed.
```

## 3. Trusted Source List

### 3.1 Internal Owned Sources

These should be the highest-priority sources for product generation because they reflect the school's own teaching style and are easiest to reuse if ownership is clear.

Examples:

- Example Client teacher-created worksheets
- Example Client contest-prep notes
- Example Client coding exercises
- Example Client class slides and homework
- Maxfield course outlines
- Maxfield lesson plans
- Maxfield teacher-created assignments
- Maxfield rubrics and sample feedback
- School-created student practice banks
- Teacher-authored explanations and answer keys

Usage status:

- Best for generation and commercial product workflows if ownership is confirmed.
- Should still be tagged by author, owner, creation date, and permission status.

| T4 | Licensed commercial | Publisher or vendor content with explicit rights | Use according to license |
| T5 | Public domain / primary source | Public-domain literature, primary-source archives | Reading/history/enrichment |
| T6 | Teacher draft | Created by a teacher but not yet approved | Internal draft only |
| T7 | Web reference only | Useful background but not controlled enough | Do not generate student-ready content directly |
| T8 | Blocked | Unclear, unsafe, restricted, or PII-heavy | Do not ingest |

## 5. Rights Categories

Every source should have a rights category separate from trust level.

| Rights Category | Meaning | Product Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `owned_by_school` | Created by school or assigned to school | Can use if ownership confirmed |
| `teacher_created_assigned` | Teacher-created and licensed/assigned to school | Can use after approval |

- Grade 12: `ENG4U`, `MHF4U`, `MCV4U`, `MDM4U`, `SBI4U`, `SCH4U`, `SPH4U`, `ICS4U`

Note:

- Course codes should be reviewed against current Ontario curriculum before official use.
- Some old course-code spellings on public websites may have typos or outdated labels.

### 7.4 Contest and Exam Categories

Use separate categories for contest/exam preparation:

- CEMC Gauss Grade 7
- CEMC Gauss Grade 8
- CEMC Pascal Grade 9
- CEMC Cayley Grade 10
- CEMC Fermat Grade 11
- CEMC Euclid Grade 12

- EQAO Grade 9 Math
- OSSLT
- AP Calculus AB/BC
- AP Computer Science A
- AP Computer Science Principles
- AP Biology
- AP Chemistry
- AP Physics
- SAT Math
- SAT Reading and Writing

## 8. Learning and Assessment Categories

### 8.1 Assessment Purpose

Every generated item should specify one purpose:

- Diagnostic
- Lesson check
- Homework practice
- Exit ticket
- Quiz
- Unit test
- Mock contest
- Exam prep
- Summative assessment
- Culminating task
- Intervention / remediation
- Enrichment / challenge

### 8.2 Ontario Achievement Categories

For Ontario private high school materials, tag assessment items with:

- Knowledge and Understanding
- Thinking
- Communication
- Application

These should be used especially for rubrics, assignments, report comments, and course assessments.

### 8.3 Cognitive Level

Use Bloom-style thinking categories:

- Remember
- Understand
- Apply
- Analyze
- Evaluate
- Create

For contest preparation, use a simpler contest difficulty category too:

- Part A / easy
- Part B / medium
- Part C / hard
- Euclid full solution
- CCC Junior
- CCC Senior

### 8.4 Difficulty Level

Use a normalized D1-D5 level for every question.

| Level | Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `D1` | Scaffolded | direct recall, one concept, guided or very low reading/calculation load |
| `D2` | Basic | one main skill, simple numbers, familiar setup |
| `D3` | Standard | grade-level practice, 2-3 steps, normal wording |
| `D4` | Challenging | multi-step or multi-concept, less direct setup, higher reasoning load |
| `D5` | Extension | contest-style, proof/analysis, transfer, or open-ended high independence |

Do not define difficulty only by grade. A Grade 7 question can be D1 or D5 depending on the task.

Difficulty should consider:

- prerequisite count
- concept count
- step count
- reading load
- vocabulary load
- calculation complexity
- abstraction level
- novelty or transfer
- answer format complexity
- rubric complexity
- expected time

Initial difficulty sources:

- teacher rating
- source anchor, such as contest part or question number
- AI estimate from structured generation
- imported source metadata

Observed difficulty sources after launch:

- correct rate
- median completion time
- hint usage
- retry count
- abandon rate
- teacher adjustment

For CEMC-style contests, Part A can map roughly to D1-D2, Part B to D3-D4, and Part C to D5, then the teacher can override. For English, difficulty should consider passage length, vocabulary, literal vs inferential reasoning, evidence requirement, and writing load.

Observed student performance should improve recommendations, but it should not silently overwrite teacher-approved difficulty metadata.

### 8.5 Question Formats

Use consistent question types:

- Multiple choice
- Multi-select
- Numeric response
- Fraction response
- Algebraic expression
- Equation solving
- Short answer
- Long answer
- Proof / justification
- Reading comprehension
- Essay / paragraph
- Coding problem
- Code tracing
- Debugging
- Data interpretation
- Diagram / graph interpretation
- Matching
- Drag/drop style

### 8.6 Validation Categories

The platform should know how each answer can be checked:

- Exact choice
- Integer equality
- Decimal tolerance
- Fraction equivalence
- Symbolic equivalence
- Unit-aware numeric answer
- Set/list equality
- Code sample tests
- Code hidden tests
- Rubric-assisted teacher review
- Manual review only

## 9. Source Workflow

Recommended source workflow:

```text
1. Add source
2. Record rights and trust level
3. Tag subject/course/topic
4. Chunk source into searchable sections
5. Teacher/admin reviews source
6. Source becomes trusted for generation
7. AI generates draft material with source citations
8. Validator checks what can be checked
9. Teacher approves output
10. Approved output becomes reusable school material
```

### 9.1 Ingestion Checklist

Before a source can be used:

- Is the source owner known?
- Is the author known?
- Is the source date/version known?
- Is the license or permission status known?
- Is the content appropriate for the grade?
- Is the content aligned to a subject/course/topic?
- Does it contain student PII?
- Is it allowed for AI processing?
- Is it allowed for student display?
- Is it allowed for worksheet export?
- Is it allowed for commercial SaaS use?

### 9.2 Output Checklist

Before AI-generated material is approved:

- Does it cite source IDs?
- Does it list topic/grade/course tags?
- Does the answer match the question?
- Are solution steps correct?
- Is the difficulty appropriate?
- Is wording age-appropriate?
- Is the content original enough when based on restricted sources?
- Has a teacher approved it?
- Is the usage allowed under the source rights category?

## 10. Recommended First Implementation

For Example Client:

```text
Start with T0 school-owned questions and T2 CEMC alignment references.
Generate original Grade 7/8 contest-style variants.
Use CEMC as topic/format alignment, not copied product content.
Use Math-Drills as optional teacher-facing basic-skills reference only, not copied SaaS content.
```

For Maxfield:

```text
Start with T0 Maxfield-owned course materials and T1 Ontario curriculum/policy references.
Generate course-aligned lesson support, quizzes, rubrics, and progress-comment drafts.
Keep teacher/principal approval before use in credit-course workflows.
```

For future client schools:

```text
Each school gets a private source library.
Each school gets a private Markdown Knowledge Vault.
No source material crosses between schools.
Every generated item keeps source lineage and rights metadata.
```

## 11. Knowledge Base Categorization

The Knowledge Base should use Obsidian-style Markdown notes as the source of truth.

Recommended KnowledgeNote properties:

```yaml
id: kb_...
type: concept | topic | skill | common_mistake | curriculum_expectation | teaching_strategy
status: draft | needs_review | approved | archived
subject: math
grade_levels: [7]
programs: [Example Client_contest_math]
topic: ratio_and_proportion
difficulty_range: [D2, D4]
source_anchors:
  - source_id: src_...
    anchor_id: anchor_...
    rights_category: teacher_owned
relationships:
  - type: prerequisite_of
    target: "[[Proportional Reasoning]]"
approved_by: teacher_id
approved_at: 2026-05-09
```

The database can index these properties for filtering and graph navigation, but KB note content should remain in the Markdown Knowledge Vault.

No vector database or embedding index is required for the core categorization system. The AI-native path is explicit Markdown notes, properties, links, backlinks, source anchors, and teacher-approved context bundles.

## 12. Minimum Source Library Tables

The future database should include:

- `source_documents`
- `source_import_jobs`
- `source_chunks`
- `knowledge_vaults`
- `knowledge_note_index`
- `knowledge_link_index`
- `source_permissions`
- `source_reviews`
- `curriculum_mappings`
- `generated_items`
- `question_versions`
- `validation_runs`
- `teacher_reviews`
- `assignment_sources`

Most important fields:

- `school_id`
- `source_id`
- `chunk_id`
- `trust_level`
- `rights_category`
- `allowed_use`
- `subject`
- `grade`
- `course_code`
- `curriculum`
- `strand`
- `topic`
- `source_url`
- `source_entry_method`
- `source_fetch_status`
- `fetched_at`
- `content_type`
- `content_length`
- `content_hash`
- `stored_object_path`
- `source_version`
- `license_notes`
- `review_status`
- `approved_by`

## 13. Summary

The platform's content advantage should come from a strong source system, not from asking AI to invent material from nowhere.

Best strategy:

```text
Official sources define standards.
School-owned sources define style.
Open/licensed sources enrich content.
Teacher review protects quality.
Source metadata protects the business.
```
