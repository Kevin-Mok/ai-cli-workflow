# ExampleProject AI Real System Coding Standard

Implement and review ExampleProject changes using shared engineering rules. Read
the relevant design references, follow the data, permission, UI, and AI
boundaries, then complete the required checks, review, and documentation
updates before delivery.

Date: 2026-05-09
Status: Draft v0.1

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how ExampleProject AI code should be written, reviewed, tested, and maintained.

Every developer and AI agent should read this document before making production-system changes.

Related documents:

- [UI Design](ui-design.md)
- [System Design](architecture.md)
- [Student Practice Package Storage Design](student-practice-packages.md)
- [Trusted Sources and Categorization](trusted-sources.md)
- [Business Point of View](business-strategy.md)

## 2. Engineering Principles

```text
Make source lineage visible.
Keep teachers in control.
Prefer clear data contracts.
Validate what can be validated.
Protect student and school data.
Ship small, reviewed changes.
```

Do not build clever AI shortcuts that bypass review, source tracking, or tenant isolation.

## 3. Language And Stack Standards

Recommended default stack:

- TypeScript for frontend application code
- React and Next.js for frontends
- Next.js static export for first production frontend deployment
- Python 3.12+ for backend API and worker services
- FastAPI for backend HTTP APIs
- Pydantic v2 for backend validation and API schemas
- PostgreSQL for primary data
- SQLAlchemy 2.x for backend database access
- Alembic for database migrations
- OpenAPI as the contract from backend to frontend
- Playwright for end-to-end UI tests
- Vitest for frontend unit tests
- pytest for backend unit tests
- Ruff for Python linting/formatting
- Pyright or mypy for Python type checking

Rules:

- TypeScript strict mode must be enabled.
- Python type hints are required for public functions, service functions, and database/repository boundaries.
- Avoid TypeScript `any`; if required, isolate it and explain why.
- Avoid Python `Any`; if required, isolate it and explain why.
- Public API input must be runtime-validated.
- API types must be generated or derived from the backend OpenAPI contract, not copied manually across apps.
- Database schema changes must be committed as migrations.

## 4. Repository Standards

Target monorepo structure:

```text
apps/
  web/
    admin/
    front/
    common/
  api/
    admin/
    front/
    common/
  worker/
packages/
  ui/
  config/
  api-client/
database/
  migrations/
  seed/
docs/
```

Rules:

- app-specific code stays inside its app
- reusable UI components go in `packages/ui`
- generated TypeScript API clients go in `packages/api-client`
- backend business/domain modules go in `apps/api/common` or the relevant `apps/api/admin` / `apps/api/front` package
- SQLAlchemy database models and repositories go in `apps/api/common` unless they later need a dedicated package
- Alembic or SQL migration files go in `database/migrations`
- seed data and local bootstrap SQL go in `database/seed`
- deterministic answer validators go in `apps/api/common` or a clearly named backend validation module
- AI prompts, schemas, and model adapters go in `apps/api/common` or a clearly named backend AI module

Module boundaries:

- keep application entrypoints thin; they should bootstrap, configure, and delegate
- split backend API code by endpoint/domain before files become large
- split frontend code into route/view modules plus reusable components
- shared helpers belong in explicit utility, service, repository, or component modules
- avoid single files that mix routing, database access, business logic, rendering, and event handling
- as a practical warning line, review any application file that grows past 300 lines and split it before it becomes a 500+ line maintenance problem

Current production implementation structure should follow the same direction:

```text
apps/api/server.py                    # local entrypoint only
apps/api/common/router.py             # shared route dispatch only
apps/api/common/server.py             # local standard-library API runtime
apps/api/common/db.py                 # database helpers/repositories
apps/api/common/source_import.py      # source-import service logic
apps/api/admin/                       # one admin-facing module per endpoint/domain
apps/api/front/                       # one student/front-facing module per endpoint/domain
apps/web/admin/app/                   # Next.js route shell
apps/web/admin/public/app.js          # current admin UI bootstrap and event wiring during React migration
apps/web/admin/public/components/     # current reusable layout and UI components during React migration
apps/web/admin/public/views/          # current one module per admin screen during React migration
```

Local and production frontend rules:

- local frontend development runs through the Next.js dev server
- local API development runs through a separate Python API server
- production frontend deployment uses `next build` static export first
- deploy generated HTML/CSS/JS to Firebase Hosting or Cloud Storage + Cloud CDN
- deploy the Python API separately as a Cloud Run service
- do not make the Python API serve the production frontend bundle
- do not put backend-only secrets, database credentials, or privileged service credentials in frontend code

## 5. Naming Standards

Use clear domain names.

Examples:

- `Source`
- `SourceAnchor`
- `KnowledgeVault`
- `KnowledgeNote`
- `KnowledgeLink`
- `GenerationProfile`
- `GenerationBatch`
- `DraftQuestion`
- `ApprovedQuestion`
- `ReviewEvent`
- `ValidationRun`
- `Assignment`
- `AssessmentBlueprint`
- `Assessment`
- `AssessmentVersion`
- `StudentAttempt`
- `StudentAttemptAnswer`
- `AttemptScore`
- `ResultSummary`

Avoid vague names:

- `Data`
- `Item`
- `Thing`
- `Obj`
- `Result2`
- `NewFlow`

IDs:

- database IDs should use UUID or cuid-style IDs
- external visible codes can be shorter slugs
- never rely on display names as unique keys

## 6. API Standards

Every API route must define:

- request schema
- response schema
- auth requirement
- tenant scope
- error cases

API responses should be predictable:

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "error": null
}
```

or:

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "SOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Source not found"
  }
}
```

Rules:

- do not return stack traces to clients
- do not expose internal model prompts to students
- do not expose another tenant's IDs or metadata
- pagination is required for large lists
- filtering and sorting should be explicit

Backend API module standards:

- each endpoint/domain should have its own Python module
- route dispatch should not contain SQL, prompt logic, or long business workflows
- database access should go through repository/helper modules, not be scattered through route handlers
- source ingestion, question generation, grading, and assessment building should each have service modules
- endpoint functions should validate input, call domain services, and return response payloads
- local prototype code can be simple, but must keep the same separation so migration to FastAPI stays clean

## 7. Database Standards

Every tenant-owned table must include:

- `tenant_id`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Most user-action tables should include:

- `created_by`
- `updated_by`

Important workflow tables should have immutable audit history.

Rules:

- use migrations, not manual production schema edits
- never run DDL from application runtime code
- never create, alter, drop, or patch database tables/indexes/columns inside request handlers, startup hooks, background jobs, seed scripts, or "auto-fix" code
- database structure changes must be applied separately through reviewed migration files and deployment steps
- app code may check that a required migration exists and fail fast with a clear error, but it must not try to repair schema at runtime
- do not delete important educational records by default; archive instead
- use foreign keys where practical
- index tenant and common filter columns
- store raw uploaded files separately from extracted text
- store source lineage separately from generated content when useful

Runtime DB connection policy:

- runtime API code must use the shared DB pool module, not direct per-request connection creation
- default pool size is 10 connections per app instance unless capacity testing changes it
- supported override environment variables are `DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE`, `API_DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE`, `DB_POOL_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SEC`, and `API_DB_POOL_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SEC`
- when the pool is exhausted, the API should wait briefly for a released connection and then fail clearly
- request code should use context-managed pooled connections so success commits, errors roll back, and connections return to the pool
- direct driver connection calls belong only inside the pool module, bootstrap/migration scripts, or focused tests
- this follows the AiUniScan pattern in `services/api/app/services/db.py`

## 8. Tenant Isolation Standards

Tenant isolation is mandatory.

Rules:

- every tenant-owned query must filter by `tenant_id`
- server-side authorization must check membership and role
- client-side hiding is not security
- background jobs must include tenant context
- source files must use tenant-scoped storage keys
- audit logs must include tenant and actor

Never add a quick endpoint that skips tenant isolation for demo convenience.

## 9. Auth And Registration Standards

Use Google login through Firebase Auth or Google Cloud Identity Platform as the default sign-in path.

Rules:

- Google/Firebase identity is not authorization.
- Every protected route must resolve the authenticated user to a ExampleProject membership.
- Teacher/admin access requires an invitation or existing membership.
- Student access requires an invitation, class code, assignment code, or existing membership.
- Public teacher self-registration into an existing school tenant is not allowed.
- Public school-owner signup is a future SaaS onboarding flow and must create a new tenant, not join an existing tenant.
- Invite tokens, class codes, and assignment codes must be scoped, expiring where appropriate, and audit logged.
- Role assignment must happen server-side.
- Never trust a client-provided role, tenant id, or membership id without server-side verification.
- Deactivated users and revoked memberships must lose access immediately.

Recommended first-launch behavior:

```text
Teacher/Admin:
invited by owner/admin -> Google login -> membership activated

Student:
assignment link/code or invite -> optional Google login -> student profile/membership connected
```

## 10. Role And Permission Standards

Use capability checks in backend code. Do not rely only on role names.

Rules:

- Every protected API route must declare the required capability.
- A user's effective permissions come from tenant membership, role, and explicit grants.
- Teacher access is usually scoped to own sources, own drafts, own classes, and assigned students.
- Reviewer/Curriculum Lead access can approve shared question-bank and shared source-library content.
- Admin access can manage users/classes/settings but still needs tenant scope.
- Owner access can manage billing, domains, roles, and tenant-level export/delete operations.
- Source visibility must be enforced server-side.
- Client-side hiding of buttons is not permission enforcement.

Teacher default capabilities:

```text
source.upload_own
source.tag_own
source.use_shared
kb_note.create_draft_own
generation.create
draft.review_own
draft.edit_own
worksheet.create_own_classes
assignment.create_own_classes
student_results.view_own_classes
```

Teacher optional capabilities:

```text
draft.publish_to_own_classes
question.approve_for_own_classes
source.share_with_class
kb_note.submit_for_review
```

Reviewer/Curriculum Lead capabilities:

```text
source.approve_tenant_shared
kb_note.approve_tenant_shared
question.approve_tenant_shared
question.reject
review.assign
teacher_content.view_for_review
taxonomy.manage_content_tags
```

Required tests:

- teacher can upload a source into own scope
- teacher can generate from own source and tenant-shared sources
- teacher can create draft KnowledgeNotes from own sources
- teacher can review/edit own generated drafts
- teacher can create draft assessments for own classes when enabled
- teacher cannot manage billing/domains/users without admin/owner capability
- teacher cannot approve tenant-shared source rights without reviewer/admin capability
- teacher cannot publish to shared question bank without reviewer/curriculum-lead capability

## 11. Source Library Standards

Every source must track:

- source title
- source owner
- source entry method: upload or URL import
- source type
- subject
- grade
- topic tags
- trust level
- rights category
- source usage status
- original URL if public
- URL fetch status, fetched_at, content type, content length, and checksum when URL-imported
- uploaded file reference if internal
- stored raw source object path
- extracted text status
- chunk/anchor status

URL import standards:

- URL downloads must run in backend workers only, never from browser code.
- Allow only `http` and `https` schemes.
- Block localhost, private IP ranges, link-local addresses, and cloud metadata endpoints to prevent SSRF.
- Enforce redirect limits, download size limits, content-type allowlists, and request timeouts.
- Do not send application cookies, user credentials, or privileged headers to source URLs.
- Do not bypass paywalls, login walls, robots restrictions, or source license terms.
- Store the fetched raw source in Cloud Storage and record checksum, fetch timestamp, URL, and fetch status.
- Treat URL-imported sources as `needs_review` until rights, trust, metadata, and allowed use are confirmed.

Every generated question must track:

- source IDs
- source anchors or chunks used
- generation batch
- model name/version
- prompt version
- transformation note
- rights usage status

Core rule:

```text
No source lineage, no approval.
```

## 12. Knowledge Base Standards

The Knowledge Base is an Obsidian-style Markdown Knowledge Vault.

Rules:

- KB note content lives in versioned Markdown files, not primarily in PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL can store relational workflow data and rebuildable indexes only
- KB notes must use stable IDs in YAML frontmatter
- KB notes should use internal links for concept relationships
- KB notes must store approval status before they can drive trusted generation
- KB notes must reference source anchors when they make source-backed claims
- graphify and LLM-generated KB notes start as draft suggestions
- teacher/reviewer approval is required before a KnowledgeNote becomes trusted
- if a KB index table is deleted, the system must be able to rebuild it from the Markdown vault
- no embedding/vector index is part of the core KB architecture
- any future semantic index requires separate design review and must be rebuildable from the Markdown vault

Required KB note fields:

- `id`
- `type`
- `status`
- `subject`
- `grade_levels`
- `topic`
- `source_anchors`
- `approved_by`
- `approved_at`

Use Markdown links for human-readable relationships, and structured frontmatter fields for relationships the app needs to query.

## 13. AI Coding Standards

AI calls must go through the AI service layer.

Rules:

- do not call OpenAI directly from UI components
- do not put API keys in frontend code
- use structured output schemas where possible
- require a Generation Profile or explicit equivalent settings for question generation
- store prompt version and model version
- store generation profile ID and version on generation batches
- store KnowledgeNote IDs and source anchor IDs used for generation
- store generated draft before teacher edits
- store generated preview drafts before teacher approval
- keep teacher edits as the authoritative reviewed content
- redact PII from logs
- add cost tracking metadata where possible

Prompt files should be versioned in Git.

AI output statuses:

- `draft`
- `needs_teacher_review`
- `validated`
- `approved`
- `rejected`
- `archived`

AI must never create `approved` content directly.

Generation Profile standards:

- do not use a raw free-text prompt as the only generation control
- every generated question must declare `question_type`, `answer_type`, `grading_mode`, and `validation_method`
- every generated question must declare `difficulty_level`, `difficulty_source`, and `difficulty_factors`
- multiple-choice questions must include choices, correct choice, and distractor notes
- short-answer questions must include expected answer rules or teacher-review notes
- open response, essay, proof, and reading questions must include a rubric or expected key points
- coding questions must include runtime, starter code if used, sample tests, and hidden-test metadata
- regenerate actions must keep the original profile/version and record teacher overrides separately
- teacher-created profiles can be personal, shared to a class/team, or approved as tenant templates
- deleting or changing a shared profile must not rewrite historical generation batches
- profile changes that affect structured output should be versioned

AI Learning Preview standards:

- do not replace Original Source Preview with AI-generated preview content
- AI Learning Preview assets are drafts until teacher-approved
- only approved preview assets can be included in student packages
- exact diagrams, labels, numbers, charts, tables, and code traces should use deterministic renderers when correctness matters
- generated bitmap images should not contain answer-revealing content
- critical text, spelling, numbers, formulas, and code should not rely on image-generation text
- store preview prompt version, model/provider, teacher instruction, asset path, alt text, status, approved_by, and approved_at
- preview regeneration must create a new preview version or review event rather than overwriting approval history
- do not send student PII into preview generation prompts
- provide alt text for every student-visible preview

Difficulty standards:

- use `D1` to `D5` internally, even if UI displays Easy, Medium, and Hard
- store teacher/source/AI estimated difficulty separately from observed student-performance difficulty
- do not silently overwrite teacher-approved difficulty based on student data
- difficulty recalibration jobs must create audit events
- open-response and essay difficulty must consider rubric complexity, not only reading level
- English difficulty must consider passage length, vocabulary, literal/inferential reasoning, evidence requirements, and writing load

Assessment Builder standards:

- AI can generate candidate exam items only; it must never finalize an assessment
- final assessment versions require teacher approval and a lock action
- locked assessment versions are immutable; edits create a new version
- assessment finalization must block unapproved draft questions
- answer keys, full solutions, and teacher rubrics are teacher-only by default
- online student assessment packages must not include answer keys before release
- every assessment item must keep question version, marks, source lineage, difficulty, validation status, and review status
- duplicate, near-duplicate, and source-overlap checks must run before finalization
- coverage reports must show topic mix, D1-D5 difficulty mix, question type mix, marks, and source coverage
- Version A/B generation must preserve equivalent topic, difficulty, mark, and question type coverage
- exam exports must be tenant-scoped and audit logged
- high-stakes assessment workflows should favor explicit teacher actions over auto-publish behavior

Result and grading standards:

- grade only against server-side answer keys, rubrics, and locked package versions
- browser-side grading can be used for immediate feedback, but server-side grading is authoritative
- store per-answer grading status, score, max score, method, and grader source
- use deterministic grading whenever possible
- AI-assisted grading can draft rubric evidence and suggested marks, but teacher review must be available
- open response, proof, essay, and complex reading answers should support partial marks and teacher adjustment
- exam marks should remain provisional until released or finalized by the teacher when the school requires it
- manual score adjustments must store old score, new score, reason, adjusted_by, and adjusted_at
- result summaries must distinguish `auto_graded`, `pending_review`, `teacher_adjusted`, and `finalized`
- do not reveal hidden tests, answer-key internals, or teacher-only rubric notes to students
- result release settings must control when students see marks, solutions, and explanations

## 14. Validation Standards

Use deterministic validators when possible.

Validator outputs should include:

- status
- method
- details
- warnings
- checked_at

Statuses:

- `passed`
- `failed`
- `not_applicable`
- `needs_teacher_review`

Validation does not equal approval.

## 15. Frontend Standards

Follow [UI Design](ui-design.md).

Rules:

- teacher/admin UI is desktop-first and compact
- student UI is mobile-friendly and focused
- use shared components for repeated patterns
- no nested cards for page layout
- no marketing hero layout inside the app
- all critical actions need loading and error states
- destructive actions need confirmation or undo
- source lineage must stay visible in review workflows
- long tables must support search/filter/sort

Frontend module standards:

- the main app file should only bootstrap data, choose the current view, wire events, and call API/client modules
- screen rendering belongs in separate view modules, one module per major screen
- reusable layout pieces such as sidebar, header/topbar, footer, workspace shell, panels, badges, metrics, tables, and form controls belong in component modules
- repeated display logic such as status badges, rights badges, metrics, and property rows must not be copied across screens
- API calls belong in an API client module, not directly inside view-rendering modules
- new UI work should add or reuse components first, then compose screens from those components
- if a view starts carrying multiple workflows, split smaller workflow components before adding more behavior

Accessibility:

- form inputs need labels
- icon buttons need accessible labels
- keyboard navigation must work for modals and forms
- color cannot be the only way to show status

Responsive quality gate:

- check 390px width
- check 768px width
- check 1280px width
- check 1440px width
- no text overlap
- no clipped primary actions

## 16. Testing Standards

Minimum tests:

- unit tests for validators
- unit tests for source classification
- unit tests for AI output parsing
- API tests for tenant isolation
- API tests for role permissions
- API tests that KB indexes rebuild from Markdown vault files
- API tests for invitation acceptance
- API tests that public teacher self-registration into an existing tenant is blocked
- API tests for student class/assignment code access
- API tests that assessment finalization blocks unapproved questions and missing answer keys
- API tests for final submit grading, marks, summary creation, and pending-review status
- API tests that student-visible summaries do not include answer-key internals
- UI smoke tests for Source Library, Knowledge Base, Generate, Review Queue, Question Bank, and Assessment Builder
- Playwright test for approving a generated question

Before merge:

- type check passes
- lint passes
- Python formatting/linting passes
- tests pass
- build passes
- changed core workflow has at least one relevant test

## 17. Security Standards

Rules:

- never commit secrets
- never log API keys
- never put student PII in AI prompts unless explicitly required and approved
- minimize student PII in the database
- use server-side permission checks
- validate file upload type and size
- scan or quarantine suspicious uploads when file processing is added
- production must use HTTPS
- production database backups must be enabled

Secrets:

- use environment variables locally
- use platform secret manager in production
- document required environment variables

## 18. Git And Review Standards

Branch naming:

```text
feature/source-library
feature/review-queue
fix/tenant-scope
docs/design-references
```

Commit style:

```text
Add English source ingestion pilot
Fix review queue source preview
Document real system UI design
```

Pull request checklist:

- what changed
- why it changed
- screenshots for UI changes
- tests run
- migration impact
- source/rights impact if content-related
- tenant/security impact if backend-related

Main branch should be protected once the real system starts.

## 19. Documentation Standards

Update docs when changing:

- navigation
- source model
- generation workflow
- approval workflow
- hosting or infrastructure
- API contract
- coding standard

Do not let docs become a museum. They should be working memory.

## 20. AI Agent Workflow

For now, repo documents are the best way to work with an AI coding agent.

At the start of a major task, the AI agent should read:

```text
~/.agents/system-design/ui-design.md
~/.agents/system-design/architecture.md
~/.agents/system-design/coding-standards.md
~/.agents/system-design/student-practice-packages.md
~/.agents/system-design/trusted-sources.md
```

Then it should inspect the code and implement within those rules.

### Docs vs Skills

Use documents for project truth:

- product decisions
- system architecture
- coding standards
- business rules
- source and rights rules

Use Skills later for repeatable AI workflows:

- "ingest a new source library"
- "generate source-aligned questions"
- "review code against ExampleProject standards"
- "prepare a release checklist"
- "create a new portal screen using ExampleProject UI patterns"

Recommended path:

1. Start with these repo documents.
2. Use them for several real development tasks.
3. When a workflow repeats three or more times, convert that workflow into a Skill.

This keeps the AI agent grounded in the repo first, while Skills become useful automation instead of another place where truth can drift.

## 21. Current Decision

The first real build should follow this standard:

- TypeScript
- shared source-lineage model
- teacher approval before student visibility
- tenant isolation from day one
- docs as project memory
- Skills later for repeated workflows
