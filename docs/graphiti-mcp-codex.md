# Graphiti MCP Server For Codex

Connect Codex to the local Graphiti memory server using this machine's Neo4j
setup. Start Neo4j, configure Codex to launch Graphiti from its checkout,
then restart Codex and verify the connection.

Checked against the working local setup on 2026-03-17.

## Working Local Setup

This machine uses Graphiti over `stdio` from
`/home/example/coding/graphiti/mcp_server` and keeps runtime settings in the
local `.env` file in that checkout.

Add this block to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.graphiti]
command = "uv"
args = [
  "run",
  "main.py",
  "--transport",
  "stdio",
  "--database-provider",
  "neo4j",
  "--model",
  "qwen3:14b",
]
cwd = "/home/example/coding/graphiti/mcp_server"
startup_timeout_sec = 120
tool_timeout_sec = 120
```

Why this setup works here:

- Graphiti loads `/home/example/coding/graphiti/mcp_server/.env` on startup, so
  Codex does not need the Neo4j or model credentials duplicated.
- `http://localhost:8000/mcp/` is not reliable on this machine because another
  local app is already bound to host port `8000`.
- The upstream Dockerized `graphiti-mcp` service also wants host port `8000`,
  so the practical local split is: keep Neo4j running, but let Codex launch
  Graphiti itself with `stdio`.
- Neo4j must already be reachable on `localhost:7687` before Codex starts the
  Graphiti server.

## Codex Launch Wrapper

This repo also installs `codex` as a wrapper script from
`scripts/executable_codex`. Before it execs the real Codex CLI, it makes
sure this same Graphiti command is already running in the background:

```bash
uv run main.py --transport stdio --database-provider neo4j --model qwen3:14b
```

That satisfies the local preference to keep the Graphiti process alive
before a Codex session starts. It does **not** change how stdio MCP
works: Codex still launches and owns its own Graphiti stdio child for
actual tool communication.

## Validation

1. Make sure Neo4j is running on `localhost:7687`.
2. Manually test the Graphiti server:

```bash
cd /home/example/coding/graphiti/mcp_server
uv run main.py --transport stdio --database-provider neo4j --model qwen3:14b
```

3. Restart Codex and confirm the MCP registration:

```bash
codex mcp list
codex mcp get graphiti --json
```

4. Optionally confirm the launch wrapper created the sidecar files:

```bash
test -f "${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/codex-launch/graphiti.pid"
test -f "${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/codex-launch/graphiti.log"
```

## Troubleshooting

- If Graphiti logs `Failed to establish connection` for `127.0.0.1:7687`, Neo4j
  is not reachable yet.
- If Codex reports that Graphiti timed out after `120` seconds, verify Neo4j
  first and then confirm the local model endpoint is available.
- If you want the default FalkorDB-based setup instead, remove
  `--database-provider neo4j` from the MCP args and follow the upstream Docker
  flow instead of this repo-local configuration.
