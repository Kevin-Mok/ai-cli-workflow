# Smoke Tests

Shared manual smoke checklist for `/home/example/linux-config`.

Update this file whenever work reveals a concrete manual verification
step or an obvious gap in smoke coverage. Keep entries grouped by area,
write them as `Action` plus `Expected`, and update stale entries instead
of stacking duplicates.

## Skills And Docs

- Action: Add or change a repo-tracked skill under `dot_agents/skills/`.
  Expected: The skill definition, `dot_agents/skills/README.md`, and the
  root `README.md` stay aligned with the new workflow the skill adds or
  changes.
- Action: Finish a task that introduced a reusable manual verification
  step or exposed a missing smoke check.
  Expected: This document gains or updates a grouped `Action` +
  `Expected` entry instead of leaving the check only in chat, plans, or
  final notes.

## Installed Skill Surface

- Action: Apply a tracked skill change to the live `~/.agents/skills/`
  install.
  Expected: The installed skill copy matches the repo-tracked source so
  future sessions see the same instructions and metadata.

## Repo Instructions

- Action: Add or change a standing workflow rule in `dot_codex/AGENTS.md`.
  Expected: The corresponding public docs and reusable verification
  guidance stay in sync with that rule in the same change.

## Keyboard And Input

- Action: Start a fresh X session on a desktop host that applies this repo's shell and `Xmodmap` config, open a terminal, type a short word, and press Backspace once.
  Expected: Exactly one character is deleted and opening a new bash shell does not rewrite the active keyboard remap.
- Action: Remap `Keychron Q11` `M2` to `Print`, start a fresh i3 session on a desktop host with the external keyboard config enabled, press `Print`, drag a screenshot region, and paste into an image-capable app.
  Expected: `scrot` captures the selected region, saves it under `~/Pictures/screenshots/desktop/unsorted/`, and the pasted clipboard contents match the captured image.
- Action: Remap `Keychron Q11` `M1` to the Menu/right-app key, press it once in i3 to open the floating ChatGPT window, let the page refresh and clear the composer, place text focus in the ChatGPT composer, then press the key again.
  Expected: The first press opens or reuses a centered floating ChatGPT window, sends a refresh, then sends `Ctrl+A` and `BackSpace` to clear leftover composer text; the second press sends `Ctrl+A`, pauses briefly, sends `Ctrl+X`, pauses briefly, closes the ChatGPT window, and resets the helper back to its initial state.

## Fish Helpers

- Action: Run `fish -ic 'refresh-config'` after changing tracked repo configuration on a machine where `chezmoi` and the shell helper scripts are available.
  Expected: The tracked `dot_codex/config.toml` overwrites `~/.codex/config.toml`, `chezmoi apply` runs, shortcuts regenerate, and fish reloads without leaving the live Codex config as the source of truth.
- Action: Run `fish -c 'backup-phone-storage'` from a machine that can
  reach the phone over SSH on port `8022`.
  Expected: If Termux has `rsync` installed, `rsync` copies the shared
  storage tree from `$PHONE_IP:/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/`
  into `/mnt/linux-files-3/pixel-9`, following Termux storage symlinks
  such as `dcim -> /storage/emulated/0/DCIM`, while showing transfer
  progress, ETA, the current path, and rsync `xfr#/to-chk` counters;
  otherwise the helper exits early with an install hint instead of
  failing mid-transfer.

## Codex And Graphiti

- Action: Launch `codex` from a shell where `~/scripts` shadows the real Codex binary and Graphiti is installed at `/home/example/coding/graphiti/mcp_server`.
  Expected: The wrapper creates or reuses `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/codex-launch/graphiti.pid`, appends Graphiti startup output to `graphiti.log`, and then hands off to the real Codex CLI with the original arguments intact.

## Vim

- Action: Open Vim or Neovim in a terminal after running `wal -i <wallpaper>` and compare the editor background and accent colors against the active terminal palette.
  Expected: Vim loads the `wal` colorscheme by default so the editor palette tracks the current `pywal` theme instead of falling back to a fixed scheme such as `nightfly` or `gotham256`.
- Action: Open Neovim in a Python project with a local `.venv` or `venv`, type `Path(` and `requests.`, and use the normal leader shortcuts on a Python symbol.
  Expected: Blink completion offers Python members and auto-import suggestions, signature help appears when typing a function call, and `<leader>do`, `<leader>g`, `<leader>rn`, and `<leader>fi` drive the Neovim LSP actions instead of the old YCM commands.
- Action: Open a Markdown file in Vim, press `<F8>`, and edit headings, lists, tables, and fenced code blocks while the preview is open.
  Expected: `markdown-preview.nvim` opens a live browser preview on a free localhost port with GitHub-like dark styling and updates as the file changes.
- Action: With the Markdown preview already open in Vim, press `<F9>`.
  Expected: The preview stops and restarts cleanly on the same file without falling back to the old `InstantMarkdownPreview` commands.

## Remote Access

- Action: Run `sudo ./scripts/executable_setup-mosh.sh` on a Linux host
  meant to accept remote `mosh` sessions.
  Expected: The script installs `mosh` when missing, opens
  `60000:61000/udp` in `ufw` or `firewalld` when one is active, and
  prints whether SSH server bootstrap still needs attention before
  remote clients can connect.
